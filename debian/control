Description: module to include stack traces on all warnings and errors
 Devel::Confess is meant as a debugging aid. It can be used to make a script
 complain loudly with stack backtraces when warn()ing or die()ing. Unlike
 other similar modules (e.g. Carp::Always), it includes stack traces even when
 exception objects are thrown.
 .
 The stack traces are generated using Carp, and will work for all types of
 errors. Carp's "carp" and "confess" functions will also be made to include
 stack traces.
